## What are Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are graphical representations of price movements
over a specific period, typically a day, week, or month. They are formed
by plotting the open, close, high, and low prices of a security during
that period, resulting in a distinctive shape that conveys crucial
information about market sentiment and price dynamics.

## Significance of Candlestick Patterns

Candlestick patterns are widely used by traders to analyze market
sentiment and potential price movements. By studying the various shapes
and formations of candlesticks, traders can glean valuable clues about
the future direction of prices.

For example, patterns like the "hammer" or "doji" signal potential trend
reversals. A hammer occurs when the price opens significantly lower than
its close, but rallies to close near its high. This suggests that buyers
are stepping in to push prices higher after a period of decline,
potentially signaling a bullish reversal.

Similarly, a doji occurs when the open and close prices are virtually
the same, indicating indecision in the market. This could signal a
potential reversal or a period of consolidation before the next
significant move.

## Types of Candlestick Patterns

There are numerous types of candlestick patterns, each with its own
unique characteristics and implications. Some of the most common and
effective patterns include:

-   Bullish Reversal Patterns: Hammer, Bullish Engulfing, Morning Star
-   Bearish Reversal Patterns: Hanging Man, Bearish Engulfing, Evening
    Star
-   Continuation Patterns: Bullish Harami, Bearish Harami, Three White
    Soldiers, Three Black Crows

1.  Identify the candlestick pattern and determine its significance.
2.  Consider the context of the pattern, including the overall market
    trend and other technical indicators.
3.  Confirm the signal using additional technical analysis tools, such
